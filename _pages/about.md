Hi, I am Arpan, a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google DeepMind. Broadly, I work with multi-agent systems, RL and decision making. I am on the outlook for PhD positions in the field of Reinforcement Learning. 

I currently work in the team Multi-agent Systems for Social Impact, developing bandit algorithms for social-good applications in a team lead by Prof. Milind Tambe (harvard University) and Dr. Aparna Taneja. Previously, I have worked at MDSR Lab, Adobe on Explainibility for Offline RL. 

I graduated in 2023 from International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Hyderabad with a dual degree of B.Tech (with Honors) and MS by Research where I earned the Programme Gold medal for the highest CGPA. My Masters research was focused on Extreme Classification and Monte Carlo Tree Search based methods under supervision of Prof. Pawan Kumar.

Outside of work, I am highly interested in all kinds of sports (especially football/soccer and TT). I also learn vocals in the Hindustani classical style and am interested in multiple genres of music.
